What is shell?

Linux systems has both CLI and GUI interfaces, when we work with Linux specially in IT we mostly
work with CLI, because most servers we work with in our work environment won't really have GUI.

The text based command line interface that helps to run commands to interact with operating system is called the Linux shell.

There are different types of shells:

1. Bourne shell (sh shell) older
2. C shell (csh or tcsh) older
3. Z shell (zsh)
4. Bourne again shell(bash) latest shell.

we can see which shell we are on by printing the value of environment variable 'SHELL' using echo
$SHELL command.

Borune again shell: This is latest and advance shell which allows us to perform arthimitic operations, conditionals, arrays etc..
