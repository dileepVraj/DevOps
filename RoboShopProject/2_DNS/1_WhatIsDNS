DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet's phone book. It translates human-friendly domain 
names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the 
network. üåêüìñ



How Domain name resolve to IP address?


You've got the basics down pretty well! Just a few tweaks to make it even clearer:

1. **Browser Cache:** When a user enters a domain name in the browser, the browser first checks its own cache for the IP address. If found, it forwards the request to the corresponding server.

2. **Operating System Cache:** If the IP address isn't in the browser cache, the browser checks the operating system's cache. If found, it retrieves the IP address and forwards the request to the server.

3. **Resolver (ISP) Cache:** If the IP address isn't in the OS cache, the browser sends a query to the resolver server (usually provided by the ISP). The resolver server checks its own cache.

4. **Root Servers:** If the IP address isn't in the resolver's cache, the resolver server queries the root servers. The root servers direct the query to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers.

5. **TLD Servers:** The TLD servers then direct the query to the appropriate authoritative name servers.

6. **Authoritative Name Servers:** The authoritative name servers finally provide the IP address associated with the domain name.

7. **Browser Request:** The IP address is returned to the resolver, then to the browser, and the browser forwards the request to the server hosting the website.

So, just to clarify, each step involves checking the cache at different levels, and if not found, the query moves up the hierarchy until the IP address is resolved.
