A **package manager** is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software packages in a Linux (or Unix-like) operating system. It simplifies software management by handling dependencies and ensuring the system has compatible versions of each required library or component.

### Functions of a Package Manager

1. **Installing Packages**:
   - Downloads and installs software from repositories, a centralized storage of software packages.
   - Resolves and installs dependencies automatically, so you don’t have to install each dependency manually.

   Example:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install package_name
   ```

2. **Updating Packages**:
   - Checks for the latest versions of installed packages and updates them to ensure security, stability, and feature improvements.
   - Can perform updates for individual packages or system-wide.

   Example:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update          # Updates package lists from repositories
   sudo apt upgrade         # Upgrades installed packages to newer versions
   ```

3. **Removing Packages**:
   - Uninstalls software packages and, optionally, removes dependencies that are no longer needed.

   Example:
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove package_name
   ```

4. **Managing Repositories**:
   - Configures software repositories (URLs or locations of package sources) from which packages are downloaded.
   - Allows adding or removing repositories, enabling access to a wider range of software.

5. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - Identifies and installs dependencies required by a package automatically, preventing "dependency hell," where mismatches cause errors.

6. **Verifying and Securing Packages**:
   - Often checks packages for integrity and authenticity using cryptographic signatures, ensuring software hasn’t been tampered with.

7. **Querying and Searching**:
   - Lets you search for packages by name, description, or category, or query information about an installed package.

   Example:
   ```bash
   apt search package_name
   ```

### Common Package Managers in Linux

- **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**: Used in Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **YUM and DNF**: Used in Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora).
- **Zypper**: Used in openSUSE.
- **Pacman**: Used in Arch Linux.

By handling dependencies, versions, and repositories, package managers make it easy to maintain a consistent, secure, and well-functioning system without manual intervention in software installations.
