In Linux, a *process* is essentially an instance of a running program. Whenever you execute a command or run a program, the system creates a process for it. Each process is assigned a unique Process ID (PID), and it can be in one of several states, such as running, sleeping, or stopped. Linux uses processes to manage system tasks and resources efficiently.

### Key Aspects of Linux Processes

1. **Parent and Child Processes**:
   - Every process in Linux is created by another process, forming a hierarchy.
   - The *init* process (PID 1) is the root of all processes, starting other processes during boot-up.

2. **Process States**:
   - Common process states include:
     - **Running**: The process is actively running or ready to run.
     - **Sleeping**: The process is waiting for a resource or event to complete.
     - **Stopped**: The process has been paused (often via signals like SIGSTOP).
     - **Zombie**: A process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.

3. **Process Control Commands**:
   - You can manage processes using commands like:
     - `ps`: Shows running processes.
     - `top` or `htop`: Provides a real-time view of running processes.
     - `kill` and `pkill`: Terminates processes based on PID or other criteria.
     - `nice` and `renice`: Adjust process priority.

4. **Process Priority**:
   - Linux allows you to adjust the priority of processes. Lower values mean higher priority, allowing critical processes to get more CPU time.

5. **Types of Processes**:
   - **Foreground Process**: Runs in the terminal and takes input from the user.
   - **Background Process**: Runs independently of the terminal, allowing the user to continue using the terminal for other commands.

Processes are fundamental to the Linux operating system, as they enable multitasking by allowing multiple programs to run simultaneously.
