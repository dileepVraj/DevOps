Objective:
To practice automating and managing processes on a Linux system, simulating the daily tasks of a DevOps engineer.

Tasks:
Monitor Running Processes:

Write a script to continuously monitor and log active processes using ps and top.

Set up alerts for high CPU or memory usage.

Automate Process Control:

Create a script to start, stop, and restart services automatically.

Use cron jobs to schedule tasks and manage routine processes.

Handle Process Failures:

Implement a watchdog script to detect and restart failed processes.

Use tools like supervisord to manage the lifecycle of critical services.

Log and Analyze Processes:

Set up logging for process activities and analyze logs to identify patterns or issues.

Create dashboards using tools like Grafana to visualize process metrics.

Document the Process:

Maintain detailed documentation for all scripts and tools used.

Include step-by-step guides for setting up and using the process management tools.

Skills Practiced:
Automation (scripting, cron jobs)

Monitoring (ps, top, logging)

Fault Tolerance (watchdog scripts, supervisord)
