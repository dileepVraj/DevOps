To list all running services in Linux, you can use the `systemctl` command (if your system uses `systemd`), which is commonly used in modern Linux distributions.

### Command to List All Active Services

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```

This command will display all currently running (active) services along with their statuses.

### Explanation
- `--type=service`: Filters to show only services.
- `--state=running`: Filters to show only active, running services.

### Alternative: Viewing All Services (Running and Stopped)

If you want to see all services (not just the running ones), you can use:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

Or, for a summary including failed services:

```bash
systemctl --type=service --all
```

These commands will show services that are running, stopped, or in any other state.
