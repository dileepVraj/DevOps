--------------------------------------------

This is a **systemd unit file** for managing the **Catalogue Service** on a Linux system. Systemd unit files define and configure system services, allowing them to be started, stopped, and managed consistently.

Here's a breakdown of each section in this file:

### [Unit] Section
- **Description=Catalogue Service**: Provides a short description of the service, in this case, "Catalogue Service." It helps identify the service's purpose in the system logs and tools.

### [Service] Section
- **User=roboshop**: Specifies that the service should run under the user account `roboshop`, which can help limit permissions.
- **Environment=MONGO=true** and **Environment=MONGO_URL=...**: These lines set environment variables. `MONGO=true` indicates that MongoDB should be used, and `MONGO_URL` provides the connection string to MongoDB, using the IP address of the MongoDB server.
- **ExecStart=/bin/node /app/server.js**: Defines the command to start the service, which in this case runs a Node.js application (`server.js`) located in `/app`.
- **SyslogIdentifier=catalogue**: Sets an identifier for log entries, making it easier to filter logs related to this service.

### [Install] Section
- **WantedBy=multi-user.target**: Ensures that this service is started in the multi-user mode, which is commonly used for non-graphical, networked services in Linux.

### How to Use:
To manage this service, you would place this file (e.g., named `catalogue.service`) in `/etc/systemd/system/`. Commands to start, stop, and enable the service are as follows:
```bash
sudo systemctl start catalogue
sudo systemctl stop catalogue
sudo systemctl enable catalogue
```

This setup is common for Node.js applications in environments that require MongoDB, helping ensure the application runs consistently and with proper configuration on each startup.

-------------------

This type of file is called a **systemd service unit file**. It is a configuration file used by **systemd**, which is the init system and service manager for many Linux distributions. This file defines how a particular service (in this case, the "Catalogue Service") should be started, stopped, and managed.

In Linux, service unit files are typically placed in `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/lib/systemd/system/` and are used to define settings such as:
- The command to start the service (`ExecStart`),
- Environment variables specific to the service (`Environment`),
- The user under which the service should run (`User`),
- Logging identifiers and descriptions to help with service management.

Service unit files enable administrators to automate and control services effectively, ensuring they start with the correct configurations on system boot or during runtime.
