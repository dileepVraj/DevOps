A **hosted zone** in Amazon Route 53 is like a container that holds the DNS records for a specific domain and its subdomains. It is part of Amazon Route 53, which is AWS's Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

There are two types of hosted zones:

1. **Public Hosted Zone:** This type of hosted zone is used to manage the DNS records for a domain that is accessible from the internet. When you create a public hosted zone, Route 53 automatically assigns four name servers to it. You need to update your domain registration with these name servers to use Route 53 for DNS.

2. **Private Hosted Zone:** This type of hosted zone is used for managing DNS records within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). It's not accessible from the internet and is used for internal DNS resolution within your VPCs.

In essence, a hosted zone helps you manage how internet traffic is routed for your domain, including subdomains, by allowing you to create and manage various DNS records such as A records, CNAME records, and more.
